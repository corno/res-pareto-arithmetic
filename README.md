this package provides several arithmetic operations for [Pareto](https://github.com/corno/pareto-documentation).

the Pareto language has a minimalistic amount of operators. There are no arithmic operators like +, -, +=, -=, *, / etcetera.
The idea is that these are only used very infrequently for actual domain specific purposes. Whenever it *is* needed, then this package can be used
